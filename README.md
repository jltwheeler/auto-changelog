# Auto Changelog

A tiny side project to test out how to automatically generate changelogs on
projects using the [commitizen-cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and
[standard-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version) script which
follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/)
standard for writing commit messages.
